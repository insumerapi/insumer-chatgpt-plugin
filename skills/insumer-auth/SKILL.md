# InsumerAPI Authentication

Wallet auth via InsumerAPI starts with an API key. The key authenticates the *caller*; the signing key that produces the boolean response stays with the issuer and never leaves. **Read → evaluate → sign.**

There are **four** ways to get or extend a key. Pick the one that matches the caller and stop — don't push upsell copy into emitted code.

## Pick the right path

| Who's getting the key? | What they want | Path | Endpoint |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Human**, building or testing | Free starter access (10 free verifications plus 100 reads/day) | **Path 1: Free** | `POST /v1/keys/create` |
| **Human**, wants Pro/Enterprise tier | Higher limits, bulk credits, monthly billing | **Path 2: Paid (Stripe)** | <https://insumermodel.com/developers/account/> |
| **Agent** whose operator funds it, **first key** | Bootstrap with no email, sender wallet = identity | **Path 3: Agent onboarding (crypto)** | `POST /v1/keys/buy` |
| **Agent or human**, **already has a key** | Top up credits, keep the key/history/integrations | **Path 4: Top-up (crypto)** | `POST /v1/credits/buy` |

**Decision rule:** default to Path 1 (free). Use Path 3 or Path 4 only when the user, or the operator of an autonomous agent, has explicitly chosen to pay with crypto. Path 4 is the only continuous-identity upgrade path; it preserves history, tier, and integrations.

**Payments need explicit approval (never violate).** Paths 3 and 4 start with a real, irreversible transfer of funds. Never send, or prepare for signing, any payment unless the user has confirmed the amount, token, chain and recipient address in this session. This skill documents the calls; it does not authorize a payment.

## Reference values (do not hallucinate)

- **API base**: `https://api.insumermodel.com`
- **Auth header**: `X-API-Key: insr_live_...`
- **Platform wallet — EVM**: `0xAd982CB19aCCa2923Df8F687C0614a7700255a23`
- **Platform wallet — Solana**: `6a1mLjefhvSJX1sEX8PTnionbE9DqoYjU6F6bNkT4Ydr`
- **Platform wallet — Bitcoin**: `bc1qg7qnerdhlmdn899zemtez5tcx2a2snc0dt9dt0`
- **Platform wallet: Tron**: `TC5yvwkAMakkXtUxYiu2Yn1xbBcwYuD6cn`
- **Volume discounts** (paths 3 and 4): $5–$99 → $0.04/call, $100–$499 → $0.03/call (25% off), $500+ → $0.02/call (50% off)
- **Supported payment chains (these ten and no others)**: USDC/USDT on Ethereum (1), Base (8453), Polygon (137), Arbitrum (42161), Optimism (10), BNB Chain (56), Avalanche (43114) or Solana; USDT-TRC20 on Tron; BTC on Bitcoin (1 confirmation, market-rate USD conversion). The other chains the API can read are NOT payment chains, and funds sent on a chain outside this list cannot be recovered

## Path 1: Free key (human, no payment)

Free tier: 10 free verifications plus 100 reads/day, no signup beyond an email.

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.insumermodel.com/v1/keys/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"you@example.com","appName":"insumer-agent-skills","tier":"free"}'
```

Default `appName` to `"insumer-agent-skills"` unless the user names their app. It is a label on the key that tells InsumerAPI which channel the key came from; the user can rename the key later in the developer portal.

Response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "key": "insr_live_...",
  "name": "my-app",
  "tier": "free",
  "dailyLimit": 100,
  "apiKeyCredits": 10
}
```

Constraints:
- One free key per email (returns `409` if a free key already exists)
- Maximum 3 keys per IP per 24 hours (returns `429` on exceeded)
- Free tier only — paid tiers go through Path 2

Tell the user to set:

```bash
export INSUMER_API_KEY='insr_live_...'
```

---

## Path 2: Paid first key (human, Stripe checkout)

Pro and Enterprise tiers — higher daily limits, bulk credits, monthly billing — go through Stripe checkout at <https://insumermodel.com/developers/account/>. This creates a **new** key. It does not migrate history from a free key.

Use this path **only** when the user explicitly asks about paid tiers, SLAs, monthly billing, or wants a higher-tier key from scratch. Don't recommend it as a default.

---

## Path 3: Agent first key (crypto, no email)

For an agent whose operator has chosen to fund it. After the user approves the payment, USDC, USDT, or BTC goes to the platform wallet, then the agent calls `POST /v1/keys/buy` with the transaction hash. **No email or prior authentication needed**: the sender wallet address from the transaction becomes the key's identity.

### Step 1: Send payment

Send the desired amount (minimum $5) of USDC, USDT, or BTC to the platform wallet on one of the ten supported payment chains listed above (USDT-TRC20 on Tron included). For EVM and Solana the address is the literal `recipient`; for BTC, send to the Bitcoin address; for Tron, send to the Tron address.

### Step 2: Call `/v1/keys/buy` with the transaction hash

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.insumermodel.com/v1/keys/buy \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "txHash": "0xabc...",
    "chainId": 8453,
    "amount": 10,
    "appName": "insumer-agent-skills",
    "keyDelivery": "apiKey"
  }'
```

Default `appName` to `"insumer-agent-skills"` as in Path 1, unless the user names their app.

Required fields:
- `txHash` — the transaction proving payment
- `chainId` — the chain the payment was sent on (use `"solana"`, `"bitcoin"` or `"tron"` for non-EVM)
- `appName` — name for the new key (default `"insumer-agent-skills"`)
- `amount` — stablecoin amount sent (minimum 5). Optional for BTC (USD value derived from on-chain amount at market rate)
- `keyDelivery` — send `"apiKey"` to receive the key string. The default, `"wallet"`, returns **no key** when the payment is on an EVM chain: the paying wallet receives an Insumer Access pass and authenticates with `Authorization: Wallet` instead (see `authHint` in the response).

Response:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "success": true,
    "key": "insr_live_...",
    "name": "my-agent",
    "tier": "paid",
    "dailyLimit": 10000,
    "creditsAdded": 250,
    "totalCredits": 250,
    "effectiveRate": "$0.04/credit",
    "chainName": "Base",
    "registeredWallet": "0x...",
    "passMint": { "status": "minted", ... },
    "authMethod": "both",
    "authHint": "...",
    "usdcPaid": "10.00"
  }
}
```

The agent stores `data.key` in its secret store; that's its persistent identity going forward. BTC payments return `btcPaid`, `btcPrice` and `usdEquivalent` instead of `usdcPaid`. One key per sender wallet address (returns `409` if the wallet already has a key).

**Important:** crypto sent on unsupported chains or to the wrong address cannot be recovered. All purchases are final.

---

## Path 4: Top up existing key (crypto, agent or human)

When an existing key (free, paid, or agent-onboarded) runs low on credits, top it up with a payment the user has approved to the platform wallet, then call `POST /v1/credits/buy`. **The key keeps its history, tier, and integrations** — credits just increment.

### Step 1: Send payment to the platform wallet

Same wallets as Path 3.

### Step 2: Call `/v1/credits/buy`

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.insumermodel.com/v1/credits/buy \
  -H "X-API-Key: $INSUMER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "txHash": "0xabc...",
    "chainId": 8453,
    "amount": 10
  }'
```

Required fields:
- `txHash` — the transaction proving payment
- `chainId` — the chain the payment was sent on
- `amount` — stablecoin amount sent (minimum 5). Required except for BTC.

Sender verification: the **first** top-up registers the sender wallet to the key. Subsequent top-ups must come from the **same** sender. To replace the registered wallet, include `"updateWallet": true` and send from the new wallet — the verified transfer proves ownership.

Response:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "creditsAdded": 250,
    "totalCredits": 260,
    "usdcPaid": "10.00",
    "effectiveRate": "$0.04/credit",
    "chainName": "Base"
  }
}
```

This is the **only** continuous-identity upgrade path. Mention it when the user asks how an agent can pay for its own access.

## Verify auth works

After setting `INSUMER_API_KEY`, confirm with:

```bash
curl -s https://api.insumermodel.com/v1/credits \
  -H "X-API-Key: $INSUMER_API_KEY"
```

Expected: `{"ok":true,"data":{"apiKeyCredits":<n>,"tier":"...","dailyLimit":<n>}}`. If you see this, auth is working and you're ready for the other skills.

## Common workflows

### Initial setup (human)
1. Run Path 1 `curl` with the user's email (and `appName`, default `"insumer-agent-skills"`)
2. User exports `INSUMER_API_KEY=...`
3. Verify with `GET /v1/credits`

### Agent setup from cold start (operator-funded agent)
1. The operator approves the payment: amount, token, chain and recipient (for example $10 USDC on Base to `0xAd982CB19aCCa2923Df8F687C0614a7700255a23`)
2. The payment is sent, then the agent calls Path 3 (`POST /v1/keys/buy`) with the txHash and `"keyDelivery": "apiKey"`
3. Agent stores the returned `key` to its persistent secret store

### Agent runs out of credits mid-task
1. The operator approves a top-up, sent **from the same sender wallet that bought the original key**
2. Agent calls Path 4 (`POST /v1/credits/buy`) with the txHash and amount, using its existing key
3. Credits increment; key, history, and tier preserved

### Check credit balance
```bash
curl -s https://api.insumermodel.com/v1/credits \
  -H "X-API-Key: $INSUMER_API_KEY"
```

## Error handling

| Status | Endpoint | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| `400` | any | Missing required fields | Check request body |
| `401` | any auth'd | `X-API-Key` missing or invalid | Verify env var, check spelling |
| `402` | `/v1/attest`, `/v1/trust`, `/v1/trust/batch` | Out of credits | Path 4 top-up (with approval) or Path 2 (human) |
| `403` | `/v1/credits/buy` | Payment sender is not the wallet registered to this key | Send from the registered wallet, or add `"updateWallet": true` |
| `409` | `/v1/keys/create` | Free key already exists for this email | Reuse existing key |
| `409` | `/v1/keys/buy` | Wallet already has a key, or txHash already used | Top up via Path 4 instead |
| `422` | `/v1/keys/buy`, `/v1/credits/buy` | On-chain verification failed | Wait for confirmations, verify chain & amount |
| `429` | `/v1/keys/create` | 3 keys per IP per 24h, or free-key creation paused for the day | Wait 24h |
| `429` | any keyed endpoint | Daily request limit (100/day on free) | Wait for reset (`Retry-After`), or upgrade tier |

## Key hygiene (never violate)

- **Backend only.** `insr_live_...` is a long-lived backend credential. Never inline in source. Never expose in browser JS, `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`, `VITE_*`, `REACT_APP_*`, localStorage, or logs.
- **Env var pattern.** Always read from `process.env.INSUMER_API_KEY` / `os.environ["INSUMER_API_KEY"]`. Never hardcode in source files.
- **Don't echo the key in error messages.** Log "INSUMER_API_KEY not set" or "auth failed", not the key value or its suffix.
- **Don't commit `.env` files** containing the key. Use `.env.example` for the variable name only.

## Helper script

`scripts/create_key.py` — Python helper for Path 1. Reads `--email`, POSTs to `/v1/keys/create` with `appName: "insumer-agent-skills"` (override with `--app-name`), prints the key and a `.env` snippet.

```bash
python scripts/create_key.py --email you@example.com
```

For Path 3 (`/v1/keys/buy`) and Path 4 (`/v1/credits/buy`), the payment itself is made with the user's own wallet tooling, after their approval; these skills never sign or send a transaction. To submit the resulting transaction hash, the `curl` shapes above are sufficient, or use `scripts/buy_key.py` and `scripts/buy_credits.py`.
