# InsumerAPI Wallet Trust Profile

A curated condition bundle for a single wallet. Same primitive as `insumer-attest` (read → evaluate → sign), but the conditions are pre-defined: 155 base checks across 27 chains in 10 dimensions, with optional cross-chain extensions. **Boolean, not balance, on every check.** Every row is a presence check.

Pick this skill when the developer wants a snapshot. Pick `insumer-attest` when they want to specify their own conditions.

## What you get

- **155 base checks** across **27 chains** in **10 dimensions** (23 EVM chains plus the Solana, XRPL, Stellar and Sui rows inside the base dimensions):
  - **Stablecoins** (52): USDC, USDT, OUSD, PYUSD, USDG, USD1, RLUSD, USDS, DAI and EURC across 23 EVM chains, including USDC on Arc and USDG on Robinhood Chain
  - **Governance** (8): UNI, AAVE, ENS, LDO, SKY and COMP on Ethereum, ARB on Arbitrum, OP on Optimism
  - **NFTs** (3): BAYC, Pudgy Penguins, Wrapped CryptoPunks
  - **Staking** (5): stETH, rETH, cbETH, wstETH, weETH
  - **Institutional stablecoins** (8): EURCV, USDCV, USDC, and BENJI across Ethereum, Solana, XRPL, Stellar, and Sui. Always present; the Solana, XRPL, Stellar and Sui entries are evaluated only when the matching wallet is supplied, and are otherwise marked `evaluated: false`
  - **Tokenized treasuries** (16): BUIDL, USYC, OUSG, USTB, USDY (the USDY on Sui row needs `suiWallet`, otherwise `evaluated: false`)
  - **Stablecoin deposits** (39): Aave v3 aUSDC/aUSDT, sUSDS, sDAI, listed Morpho USDC vaults
  - **Wrapped bitcoin** (12): cbBTC, WBTC, tBTC
  - **Names** (2): ENS .eth, Basenames
  - **Account** (10): two rows per chain on Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism and Polygon. "Contract code on X" is met when bytecode other than the EIP-7702 delegation designator is at the wallet address; "EIP-7702 delegation on X" is met when the designator is there. The two are exclusive per chain; a plain key account reads false on both. Which contract is never named; to require a specific delegation target, send `delegate` with an `account_code` condition in `insumer-attest` (the answer is still yes or no). Each row's `evaluatedCondition` is `{type: "account_code", chainId, expect, operator: "code_state"}`, hashed exactly like the equivalent attest condition
- **Optional extensions** (when extra wallet addresses are provided):
  - **Solana** (14): pass `solanaWallet` (USDC, EURC, OUSD, PYUSD, USD1, USDG, USDS, BUIDL, USDY, WBTC, cbBTC, tBTC, JitoSOL, mSOL on Solana)
  - **XRPL** (3): pass `xrplWallet` (RLUSD, USDC, OUSG)
  - **Bitcoin** (1): pass `bitcoinWallet` (native BTC)
  - **Tron** (3): pass `tronWallet` (USDT, USD1, WBTC)
  - **Stellar / Sui**: pass `stellarWallet` / `suiWallet`. These add no checks and no dimension; they let the Stellar and Sui rows inside the base dimensions be evaluated
- Up to 176 total checks across 29 chains in 14 dimensions when all extensions are included
- Each check returns its own boolean; the response includes per-dimension and overall summaries
- Dimension order is fixed: the base dimensions in the order above (`stablecoins`, `governance`, `nfts`, `staking`, `institutional_stablecoins`, `tokenized_treasuries`, `stablecoin_deposits`, `wrapped_bitcoin`, `names`, `account`), then whichever of `solana`, `xrpl`, `bitcoin`, `tron` were switched on, in that order
- `conditionSetVersion` is a dated set id (currently `"2026-10-08"`), the same on every key version, signed with the profile. It names the check list that was run: log it, never reject on it
- 3 credits standard, 6 credits with `proof: "merkle"`

## Architectural property to preserve

The whole trust profile is signed once by InsumerAPI: one `sig` covers the entire `trust` object. The response is signed twice: ES256 (`sig`, `kid`) and a post-quantum ML-DSA-65 signature (`pqSig`, `pqKid`, optional fields: check them when present). The `kid` is `insumer-trust-v2` on v2 keys and `insumer-attest-v1` on v1 keys: read it from the response, never assume it. There are no per-dimension or per-check signatures. **Do not add an orchestrator-layer wrap.** If you build a multi-issuer trust envelope that includes this profile, carry the signed object exactly as issued, beside the other issuers' signed objects, and never re-sign it or wrap it under a new envelope signature. Verifiers should be able to check InsumerAPI's signature directly against its JWKS.

## Setup

```bash
export INSUMER_API_KEY='insr_live_...'
```

## Reference values

- **Endpoint**: `POST https://api.insumermodel.com/v1/trust`
- **Cost**: 3 credits standard, 6 credits with `proof: "merkle"`
- **Wallet pattern**: `wallet` is required (EVM, `0x` + 40 hex chars). `solanaWallet`, `xrplWallet`, `bitcoinWallet`, `tronWallet`, `stellarWallet` (G-address) and `suiWallet` (`0x` + 64 hex chars) are optional add-ons.
- **Trust profile ID format**: `TRST-XXXXX` (returned in `data.trust.id`)

## Usage

### Example 1: EVM-only profile

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.insumermodel.com/v1/trust \
  -H "X-API-Key: $INSUMER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "wallet": "0x1601843c5E9bC251A3272907010AFa41Fa18347E"
  }'
```

Response shape (abbreviated; the counts are from a real profile of this wallet, a contract on all five account chains):

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "trust": {
      "id": "TRST-81224",
      "wallet": "0x1601843c5E9bC251A3272907010AFa41Fa18347E",
      "conditionSetVersion": "2026-10-08",

      },
      "summary": { "totalChecks": 155, "totalPassed": 16, "totalFailed": 132, "totalNotEvaluated": 7, "dimensionsWithActivity": 3, "dimensionsChecked": 10 },
      "profiledAt": "2026-10-07T21:53:04.795Z",
      "expiresAt": "2026-10-07T22:23:04.795Z"
    },
    "sig": "...",
    "kid": "insumer-trust-v2",

    "pqKid": "insumer-trust-pq1"
  },

}
```

The first two `account` rows of that profile, as signed:

```json
{"label":"Contract code on Ethereum","chainId":1,"met":true,"evaluatedCondition":{"type":"account_code","chainId":1,"expect":"contract","operator":"code_state"},"conditionHash":"0xfd7b6aa42eb012184fa54d9d5d99c6ab18481e0ce33ec0ec0e9d28d37b54ccbc","blockNumber":"0x18eea5a","blockTimestamp":"2026-10-07T21:52:59.000Z"}
{"label":"EIP-7702 delegation on Ethereum","chainId":1,"met":false,"evaluatedCondition":{"type":"account_code","chainId":1,"expect":"eip7702","operator":"code_state"},"conditionHash":"0xdef6fadcef95f59f4621fa2bf788e6be0ffc0492dba22038999b8cd757adf18b","blockNumber":"0x18eea5a","blockTimestamp":"2026-10-07T21:52:59.000Z"}
```

### Example 2: With a Solana wallet

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.insumermodel.com/v1/trust \
  -H "X-API-Key: $INSUMER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "wallet": "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045",
    "solanaWallet": "DXK4yMpigbTSqv33nJk1tJucXB4E3rDmTXn3yZmiFAXt"
  }'
```

### Example 3: Multi-chain profile (EVM + Solana + XRPL + Bitcoin)

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.insumermodel.com/v1/trust \
  -H "X-API-Key: $INSUMER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "wallet": "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045",
    "solanaWallet": "DXK4yMpigbTSqv33nJk1tJucXB4E3rDmTXn3yZmiFAXt",
    "xrplWallet": "rN7n7otQDd6FczFgLdSqtcsAUxDkw6fzRH",
    "bitcoinWallet": "bc1qar0srrr7xfkvy5l643lydnw9re59gtzzwf5mdq"
  }'
```

Each provided Solana, XRPL, Bitcoin or Tron wallet adds its dimension to the response. A Stellar or Sui wallet (`stellarWallet`, `suiWallet`) adds no dimension; it lets the matching rows inside the base dimensions be evaluated instead of marked `evaluated: false`: the Stellar and Sui institutional-stablecoin entries, and for Sui also USDY on Sui in tokenized treasuries.

### Example 4: Merkle proofs (advanced)

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.insumermodel.com/v1/trust \
  -H "X-API-Key: $INSUMER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "wallet": "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045",
    "proof": "merkle"
  }'
```

An EVM token row carries an EIP-1186 storage proof when its balance slot can be discovered. Computed-balance rows (Aave aTokens, BUIDL), rows with non-standard storage layouts, and rows on chains that serve no proofs are declined with a reason; NFT and non-EVM rows are declined; `account` rows carry `proof.available: false` with a reason pointing at `/v1/attest`, where an `account_code` condition in proof mode carries the account proof; unevaluated checks carry no proof key. **Costs 6 credits** instead of 3; the premium is refunded whenever no proof could be delivered. Proofs reveal raw on-chain balances. Only opt in if the consumer explicitly needs the raw balances.

## When to use trust profile vs. custom attest

| User asks for... | Use |
|---|---|
| "Verify this wallet holds X on chain Y" | `insumer-attest` |
| "Gate by USDC balance on Base" | `insumer-attest` |
| "Pre-transaction trust check" | `insumer-trust` |
| "Show me what this wallet holds across chains" | `insumer-trust` |
| "Multi-dimensional wallet profile" | `insumer-trust` |
| "Should I transact with this wallet" | `insumer-trust` |

For multiple wallets in one call, use `insumer-trust-batch`.

## Code emission rules

1. **Read the API key from an env var.** Never inline.
2. **Verify the signature offline.** Use `insumer-jwks-verify`. The signed boolean(s) is the product.
3. **Don't re-sign or wrap the profile.** One InsumerAPI signature covers the whole `trust` object; placing it under a new envelope signature defeats the verification chain. A check whose wallet was not supplied is marked `evaluated: false` and counted in `totalNotEvaluated`, never as a failure.
4. **Don't cache the verdict.** Cache the JWKS, not the trust profile result. Wallet state changes.
5. **Backend only.** The API key is a backend credential.

## Helper script

`scripts/trust.py`: Python helper that wraps `POST /v1/trust`. Reads `INSUMER_API_KEY` from env, accepts `--wallet`, `--solana`, `--xrpl`, `--bitcoin`, `--tron`, `--stellar`, `--sui`, `--proof merkle`.

```bash
python scripts/trust.py --wallet 0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045
```

## Error handling

| Status | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `400` | Missing `wallet` or invalid format | EVM wallet `^0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}$` is required |
| `401` | Invalid API key | See `insumer-auth` |
| `402` | With a key: out of credits. With no key at all: a pay-per-call quote, not a credit problem | With a key, top up via Path 4 in `insumer-auth`. With no key, set `INSUMER_API_KEY` and call again |
| `429` | Daily request limit reached | It resets on a timer, not by slowing down: wait the number of seconds in the `Retry-After` header |
| `503` | Upstream blockchain data source unavailable | Retryable; no credits charged |

A `503` carries error code `rpc_failure`. It means a read did not complete and nothing was signed. It is never a `false`: do not report it as a check that was not held. Retry the call.
